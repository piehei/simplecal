# simplecal
Chrome/Firefox extension that makes a simple calendar popup.

I needed a simple, easy, and fast way to check calendar on my Chromebooks so I decided to play around with the Chrome extension API and release this.

It doesn't do anything fancy, and most likely you do not need it. But I guess some other Chromebook folks might find it useful (the ChromeOS platform lacks the usual calendar widget you get elsewhere by clicking on the clock).
